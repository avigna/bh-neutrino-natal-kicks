## Constraints on neutrino natal kicks from  black-hole binary VFTS 243

## Documentation
These scripts have been developed to visualize and present results from [Vigna-G贸mez et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01509)
Including the visualization of the orbital parameters of observed black-hole binaries (Fig. 2, S5 and S6) and the neutrino asymmetry analysis (Fig. S2 and S4). 
For additional details we refer to the manuscript, its Supplemental Material, and the scripts in this repository.

## Resources
The anaylsis on the natal kick (Fig. 1, S1 and S3) was performed using the [natal kick](https://github.com/reinhold-willcox/BH_neutrinos) repository from Reinhold Willcox.
